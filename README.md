I developed an ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) pipeline for data engineering. This pipeline extracts data from two JSON files containing a list of banks by market cap, transforms the data by converting it using exchange rates from a CSV file (with all currencies referenced to USD), and then loads the processed data into a new CSV file.

You can read through the details of the project in [ETL_Project](https://github.com/Zainal606/Python_ETL_P1/blob/main/ETL_Project.ipynb)

Input files used for the Project 
1. [Bank_Market_cap_1](https://github.com/Zainal606/Python_ETL_P1/blob/main/Bank_Market_cap_1.json)
2. [Bank_Market_cap_2](https://github.com/Zainal606/Python_ETL_P1/blob/main/Bank_Market_cap_2.json)
3. [exchange_rates](https://github.com/Zainal606/Python_ETL_P1/blob/main/exchange_rates.csv)

Output files
1. [bank_market_cap_gbp](https://github.com/Zainal606/Python_ETL_P1/blob/main/bank_market_cap_gbp.csv)
2. [logfile](https://github.com/Zainal606/Python_ETL_P1/blob/main/logfile.txt)
