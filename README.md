I developed an ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) pipeline for data engineering. This pipeline extracts data from two JSON files containing a list of banks by market cap, transforms the data by converting it using exchange rates from a CSV file (with all currencies referenced to USD), and then loads the processed data into a new CSV file.

You can read through the details of project in [Section `Project`](#ETL_Project.ipynb)
